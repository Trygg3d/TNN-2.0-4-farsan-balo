1. Define the structure of the neural network:
   - Input layer to accept time-series data
   - Kernel Filter layer to extract features
   - Time Attention layer to focus on important features
   - Output layer to predict future data

2. Implement the Kernel Filter:
   - Initialize filters with learnable weights
   - Define convolution operation across time dimension

3. Develop the Time Attention mechanism:
   - Compute attention scores for each time step
   - Normalize the attention scores
   - Apply attention scores to kernel filter outputs

4. Assemble the network:
   - Stack the layers in sequence
   - Define forward pass to process data through each layer

5. Training loop:
   - Load data and split into training and validation sets
   - Train the model using backpropagation and an optimizer
   - Validate the model on the validation set
   - Adjust hyperparameters and repeat as necessary

6. Evaluation:
   - Assess model performance using metrics such as RMSE and MAE
   - Compare to baseline models if provided
